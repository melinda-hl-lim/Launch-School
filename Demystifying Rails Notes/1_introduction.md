### Foreword

This isn't a manual about how to use Rails. It's a journey behind the scenes to see:
- life in web applications without a framework to help us understand *why* we web-app frameworks exist
- pains that arise when building a web app with no framework, so that conventions from the framework make sense in context

Launch School believes that before we do it with Rails, we need to understand how to do it without.

### Prerequisites

- Command Line
- Ruby
- OO Ruby
- HTTP
- SQL
- Basic HTML

Note that Launch School has a handy-dandy book for all topics except Basic HTML.

### Guide Structure

The book is divided into two parts. Below is a quick summary of each.

#### (1) No Magic Rails

LS tries to use very little Rails conveniences. We start with some web application basics and then move to writing a simple blogging application.

Goal: painstakingly build a web-app without any conventions or conveniences provided by Rails. This process exposes fundamental web-dev concepts, and reveals a lot of the pains that Rails alleviates.

#### (2) Rails Core Conventions

We'll redo our blog application with knowledge of common web-dev patterns and a better understanding of the problems they relate to. We'll redo our app with Rails!


### NOTE

Rails is more than a tool. Its conventions give us a way of thinking about web-apps and an organizational structure for implementing them.

It's important to understand the reasons for the mechanisms of the framework so we can adapt them to fit our needs.
