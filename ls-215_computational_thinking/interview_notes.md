8:59 pm - Reading problem
  - You confirmed edge cases! :)
    - Input: ever 0 for either argument?
    - Input: ever <0 for second argument?

9:02 pm - Started typing to process the problem
  - Input, output, data structure, rules
  - I didn't quite understand your rules
    - start with 0 --> what starts with 0?
  - Oh no! There's an issue with the output logic!
    - assumption that the last person standing is (index + 1)

9:06 pm - Start writing out algorithm
  - I'm not quite sure I understand the action 'mod the length'
  - I like how you used the console to explain my confusion with 'mod the length'
  - I felt that your pseudocode was very high level (not a bad thing!). It didn't jump into the details of how you would accomplish each step.

9:11 pm - Started coding!
  - I like the testing in console as you figure out the details of your code. The console.log *is* very helpful!
  - 9:19 pm - Indexing issues during coding
    - I'm trying to solve the issue with you too ^^;
    - You didn't go back to your pseudocode since it's not super fleshed out. I honestly don't know if there's a pseudocode way to help with indexing issues though...
    - OH you're using `num` as the array length, but the array length is changing as you're splicing... 
  - 9:27 pm: solved the first indexing issue!
    - You figured out that the `-1` is necessary to shift the index count back 1 (so you account for the shift in people's positions when you remove one person)

9:36 pm - Coding done!
