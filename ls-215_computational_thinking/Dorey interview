Biggest challenge:
- Complete through PEDAC process
  - downfall: test cases
  - rushing through process

Time start!

3:00 First mention of algorithm. You didn't give in to the temptation though!

3:20 Yay! You talked about test cases
  - You are trying to think of edge cases! Couldn't think of any (neither can I)
  - I terms of test cases, maybe check behaviour? LIke rolling over of time. 23:59:59 to 24

6:00 Algorithm
  - You think about the algorithm in very low levels: thinking about data types, initializing variables, ...
  - Screenshot at 7:30
  - After the screenshot, you say "I need to get more specific about how I will convert" I felt that you did need to figure out the math specifics, but you were already very specific about other aspects (see first bullet point)
  - Spent about 5 minutes confirming math logic
    - Note: no notion of *how* to string format. So in that sense, this part of the problem is still in the high level algorithm part 

12:30 Coding time!

  - Math confusion at 17:00. Not sure if it's a math-thing, or if it reflects a lack of precision/clear steps in your algorithm
    - You went back to your algorithm at 20:00! That's good! IT also seemed to help you regain your train of thought
    - After confirming and finding the math logic, you went to log the results of the algorithm. ~22:00

24:30 Pass all test cases!
